# Mobile Support Overview

**RadSwitch** for ASP.NET AJAX is a mobile friendly control that works on wide screens as well as on smaller screens. By design, the control has lightweight rendering that is based on the latest web technology (i.e., HTML5 and CSS3).

The responsive web page design is not built-in the control, but you can facilitate it by applying the styles suggested in the  [Controlling Appearance]({%slug switch/appearance-and-styling/controlling-appearance%}) help article.
